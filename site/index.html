	      <p>In achalasia, nerve cells in the esophagus (the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach) degenerate for reasons that are not known. The loss of nerve cells in the esophagus causes two major problems that interfere with swallowing: </p>
			
	      <ul>
	      <li>The muscles that line the esophagus do not contract normally, so that swallowed food is not moved through the esophagus and into the stomach properly.</li>
	    
	      <li>The lower esophageal sphincter (LES), a band of muscle that encircles the lower portion of the esophagus, does not function correctly. Normally, the LES relaxes when we swallow to allow swallowed food to enter the stomach.</li>
	      </ul>
	     
	      <p>When the food has moved through the esophagus into the stomach, the LES muscle contracts to squeeze the end of the esophagus closed, thus preventing the stomach contents from flowing backwards (refluxing) into the esophagus.</p>
	      
		  <p>In people with achalasia, the LES fails to relax normally with swallowing. Instead, the LES muscle continues to squeeze the end of the esophagus, creating a barrier that prevents food and liquids from passing into the stomach. Over time, the esophagus above the persistently contracted LES dilates, and large volumes of food and saliva can accumulate in the dilated esophagus.</p>

	  <h2><span>My story</span></h2>
	   <div class="dropdown-content">
	      <img src="img/me.png" alt="me" width="140" height="160"><p> I recall beginning to have difficulty with swallowing food, towards the end of 2014. At first i thought that i was not relaxing when i ate and was rushing through my meals and not chewing my foods well. As it was happening more frequently i tried to pay close attention to what type of foods might be the problem. Growing concerned i began to tell my family about it, because i would take longer than them to get through a meal.</p> 

	      <P>Towards the beginning of 2015 after a followup with my doctor i began sharing my concerns, and she immediately knew what type of exam might offer insights. An ultrasound of my neck and a Barium swallow test helped in finding a diagnosis. At first my doctor suspected it was dysphagia, receiving a name was comforting because i at least knew something was wrong and i was not imagining something was wrong. Googling canâ€™t get you too far. After the results showed it was achalasia i was referred to a Gastroenterologist.</p> 

	      <p>I went in knowing what it was already but in order to have a concrete diagnosis he also had me do a  manometry test which requires like a cable go through your nose down the back of your throat in order to measure, i believe the movement of the esophagus, it was such a hard test to do i almost could not get through it. But because of that test the doctor suspect that there could be something outside of my esophagus pushing it and causing the difficulty swallowing, so i had to get a chest X-ray done. After that proved to be negative what was left to do was an endoscopy. To check my esophagus from the inside and at the same time take a sample to test for cancer among other diseases. Everything came back normal, and it proved that indeed it was achalasia. The problem was the lower esophageal sphincter not allowing food to go into the stomach and, the motility being weak allowing food to get stuck in my esophagus. After this it was still not a definite treatment because although i received medicine it was mostly to treat heartburn not achalasia.</p>

	      <p>I was referred to a surgeon because the G.I doctor believed that to be the most effective treatment. The moment i went to the surgeon i took all my diagnosis history with me and he immediately asked me when i wanted to have surgery, he also went over the fact that this could help me eat a little better but it was not a cure for it. i would still have to make sure i eat a soft diet, stay away from coffee, breads, meats. And being that i have achalasia i have to make sure to get an endoscopy done every 2 years, because there is a higher risk for esophageal cancer.  I had to learn so many things along the road, from sleeping positions, to eating comfortable foods, to learning how to always make sure i drink water with my meals, and carry a bottle of water wherever i go. Specially, to learning to deal with the spasms in my esophagus. Its been a tough road but if i didn't have my parents support i would have already lost my mind through it all.</p>

	   <h2><span>Symptoms</span></h2>

	   <div class="dropdown-content">
	   <img src="img/internal.jpeg" alt="internal organs" width="340" height="240">
	     <p>Patients often experience the sensation that swallowed material, both solids and liquids, gets stuck in the chest. This problem often begins slowly and progresses gradually. (Many people do not seek help until symptoms are advanced.)</p>

		<ul>
		<li><p>The most common symptom of achalasia is difficulty swallowing.</p></li> 

		<li><p>Can also include chest pain, (esophageal spasms)</p></li>

		<li><p>regurgitation of swallowed food and liquid, (can also happen at night with cough while laying down)</p></li>

		<li><p>heartburn,</p></li>

		<li><p>difficulty burping,</p></li>

		<li><p>a sensation of fullness or a lump in the throat,</p></li>

		<li><p>hiccups,</p></li>

		<li><p>weight loss,</p></li>

		<li><p>Some people compensate by eating more slowly and by using maneuvers, such as lifting the neck or throwing the shoulders back, to improve emptying of the esophagus.</p></li>

		<li><p>inducing regurgitation to relieve pain,</p></li>

		<li><p>malnutrition maybe possible as one alters eating habits for ease of eating</p></li>
